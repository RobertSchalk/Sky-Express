# Sky Express


I've decided to go ahead and spare some time in creating an application that will be able to view you emails. This application will be built using Electron.JS.

Sky Express will be a cross-platform service that will allow you to view all of your emails in one location. It will be light-weight, and be compatable with many common emails. The app will also come with a built-in calendar for reminders and to store possible events. As I further development of this application, I will add documentation.
